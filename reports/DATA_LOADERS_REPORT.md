## 🔧 Data Generators Configuration

### Training Generator (with augmentation)
```python
ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True
)
```

### Validation/Test Generators (normalization only)
```python
ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
```

## 📊 Data Loaders Statistics

| Generator | Images | Batches | Batch Size | Shuffle |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Training** | 4,099 | 129 | 32 | Yes ✅ |
| **Validation** | 878 | 28 | 32 | No |
| **Test** | 879 | 28 | 32 | No |

**Class Mapping:**
- NORMAL → 0
- PNEUMONIA → 1

---

## 🧪 Pipeline Testing

### Batch Shape Validation
```
✅ Batch images shape: (32, 224, 224, 1)
✅ Batch labels shape: (32,)
✅ Pixel value range: [0.0, 1.0]
✅ Data type: float32
```

### Batch Examples

## 📈 Distribution Analysis

![Distribution](docs/images/09_loader_distribution.png)

**Verified Distribution:**
- Training: 27.0% NORMAL / 73.0% PNEUMONIA ✅
- Validation: 27.0% NORMAL / 73.0% PNEUMONIA ✅
- Test: 27.1% NORMAL / 72.9% PNEUMONIA ✅

**Consistency:** Perfect stratification maintained across all splits.

## ⚖️ Class Weights Integration

### Calculated Weights
```python
class_weights = {
    0: 1.850,  # NORMAL
    1: 0.685   # PNEUMONIA
}
```

### Usage in Training
```python
model.fit(
    train_generator,
    validation_data=val_generator,
    class_weight=class_weights,
    epochs=50
)
```

**Expected Impact:** +1.0% to +1.5% accuracy improvement

## 📦 ML Engineer Package

Created `data_loader.py` - Ready-to-use Python class:
```python
from data_loader import PneumoniaDataLoader

# Initialize
loader = PneumoniaDataLoader(
    base_path='data/preprocessed',
    img_size=224,
    batch_size=32
)

# Get generators
train_gen, val_gen, test_gen, class_weights = loader.get_generators()

# Start training immediately
model.fit(
    train_gen,
    validation_data=val_gen,
    class_weight=class_weights,
    epochs=50
)
```
